I chose USB Debugging as my research option. What this option does is allow Android devices to
 communicate with development tools such as Android Studio via USB, 
allowing developers to install apps, debug code, view logs, and more directly on the device. 
Since I need to deploy applications to physical devices for testing in the course, USB debugging will be a feature I use frequently. 
This allows me to see how the application is performing on the actual device and makes debugging and problem solving easier. 
Therefore, I think I will use this feature a lot during this semester.
